# REM
The PrikolsHub Killer.

**REM is built and tested on Linux, support for Windows is not guaranteed.**

### How to get started

> [!TIP]
> You do not need to configure REM again, when it updates. However, you will still need to run `post_update.sh`, so stuff doesn't break.

Configure all settings in `config.json`, then copy the template `.env.template` to `.env` with `cp .env.example .env`, then configure it.

After all of that, run the provided `post_update.sh`, which will install all dependencies, configure the database, then build it.

```
sudo chmod +x post_update.sh
./post_update.sh
```

### Now what?

Add `run.sh` to PM2 or a systemd service.
