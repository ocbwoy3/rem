# REM.ts
A rewrite of the REM Remote Admin, but in TypeScript.

> [!WARNING]
> REM is still work-in-progress.

## How to get started

Install the necessary packages, rename `.env.example` to `.env`, configure Token and App ID, configure channels and bans in `config.json`

Do `npm run build` and `npm run start` to start REM. Using `npm run dev` is also an option.
